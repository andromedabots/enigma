### Development
Full documentation is coming soon, but you can feel free to ask Shadow any questions about the setup
The `re` variable available in every command and file is sourced from [resources.js](resources.js). The global variables there are sourced from [here](https://github.com/andromedabots/global).
[Mongoose](https://npmjs.org/package/mongoose) is what we use to access our database. All the schemas are available under `re.db` and use normal mongoose methods
